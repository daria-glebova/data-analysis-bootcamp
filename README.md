## üìñ Project 1
### Prediction of the computer games success

*Data:* historical data on sales of computer games in the Strimchik online store, containing information on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms, etc. for 1980-2016.

*The purpose:* identify patterns that determine the success of the game, which will allow Strimchik to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns for 2017.



## üìñ Project 2
### Reasons for the company unprofitability

*Data:* data is available for users acquired during advertising campaigns from May 1 to October 27, 2019 for the Procrastinate Pro+ entertainment app. Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been losing money for the past few months.

*The purpose:* to understand the reasons for the company's losses and help it to become profitable.

*Tasks:*

- find out where users come from and what devices they use;
- calculate how much it costs to attract users from various advertising channels;
- calculate how much money each client brings;
- determine when the cost of attracting a client pays off;
- find out what factors hinder customer acquisition.


## üìñ Graduation Project
### Analysis of acqiusition sources in a mobile game

*Data:* three datasets contain the data of the first users of the mobile game "Space Brothers" application ‚Äî the cohorts of users who started using the application (the first level in the game) from May 4 to May 10, 2020 inclusive. It is assumed that the app will display ads on the screen with a choice of the type of object to be built. Completing the first level of games requires the player to fulfill one of two conditions:
- Defeat the first enemy
- Implementation of the project - development of an orbital assembly of satellites

*The purpose:* to decompose tasks, to analyze the behavior of players depending on the source of the transition to the game, to identify the potentially most profitable source and to prepare a presentation for customers.
