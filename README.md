## 📖 Project 4
### Hypothesis prioritization and analysis of A/B test results

✅ *Status:* **completed**

*Data:* data from a large online store containing 9 hypotheses for increasing the revenue of an online store with the specified parameters Reach, Impact, Confidence and Effort, users' orders in the online store, site visits by users.

🎯*The purpose:* Prioritize hypotheses, run an A/B test, and analyze the results.

*Tasks:*
- Apply ICE and RICE frameworks to prioritize hypotheses;
- Look at changes in cumulative revenue, average check and average number of orders per visitor by groups;
- Check for differences in average bookings per visitor between groups;
- Check for differences in the average check between groups;
- Find out if there are significant outliers in the data, "clear" the data from them and repeat the stat. tests;
- Make a decision based on the test results: stop the test and fix the results or continue the A/B test.

## 📖 Project 5
### The bank borrower reliability study

✅ *Status:* **completed**

*Data* from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers. The customer is the credit department of the bank. It is necessary to find out whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to return a loan to a bank.

## 📖 Graduation Project
### Analysis of acqiusition sources in a mobile game

✅ *Status:* **completed**

*Data:* three datasets contain the data of the first users of the mobile game "Space Brothers" application — the cohorts of users who started using the application (the first level in the game) from May 4 to May 10, 2020 inclusive. It is assumed that the app will display ads on the screen with a choice of the type of object to be built. Completing the first level of games requires the player to fulfill one of two conditions:
- Defeat the first enemy
- Implementation of the project - development of an orbital assembly of satellites

🎯*The purpose:* to decompose tasks, to analyze the behavior of players depending on the source of the transition to the game, to identify the potentially most profitable source and to prepare a presentation for customers.
